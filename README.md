# üõ°Ô∏è My Cybersecurity Home Lab Portfolio: InfoSec-HomeLab

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio documenting the construction, configuration, and analysis of my personal cybersecurity home lab. The projects within this lab are designed to provide hands-on experience across various cybersecurity domains, aligning with my academic pursuits and certifications (SSCP, CySA+, PenTest+).

## üöÄ Lab Overview & Goals

My primary objective is to cultivate practical skills in building, defending, and ethically attacking network environments. This lab provides a controlled space for:
- **Security Administration:** Implementing foundational security controls and infrastructure.
- **Defensive Operations (Blue Team):** Threat hunting, incident response, and security monitoring.
- **Offensive Security (Red Team):** Vulnerability analysis and ethical exploitation.

This portfolio aims to showcase direct experience and problem-solving capabilities in a realistic, virtualized environment.
